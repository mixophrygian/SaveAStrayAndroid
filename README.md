## Save a Stray - Android

(updated Sept 2018 to use react-navigator, yelp-fusion and a host of other non-deprecated things)

Hello! I am the Android version of the Save a Stray app, written in React Natve. Behold my vast differences from the iOS version, namely the completely different implementation of the navigation, due to the usage of Navigator IOS in the original, iOS build.
